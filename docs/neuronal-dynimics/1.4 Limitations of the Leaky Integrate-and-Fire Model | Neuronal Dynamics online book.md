The leaky integrate-and-fire model presented in Section [1.3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html "1.3 Integrate-And-Fire Models ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition") is highly simplified and neglects many aspects of neuronal dynamics. In particular, input, which may arise from presynaptic neurons or from current injection, is integrated linearly, independently of the state of the postsynaptic neuron:

so that no memory of previous spikes is kept. Let us list the major limitations of the simplified model discussed so far. All of these limitations will be addressed in the extension of the leaky integrate-and-fire model presented in Part II of the book.

To study neuronal dynamics experimentally, neurons can be isolated and stimulated by current injection through an intracellular electrode. In a standard experimental protocol we could, for example, impose a stimulating current that is switched at time  from a value  to a new value . Let us suppose that  so that the neuron is quiescent for . If the current  is sufficiently large, it will evoke spikes for . Most neurons will respond to the current step with a spike train where intervals between spikes increase successively until a steady state of periodic firing is reached; cf. Fig. [1.10](#Ch1.F10 "Fig. 1.10 ‣ 1.4.1 Adaptation, Bursting, and Inhibitory Rebound ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")C. Neurons that show this type of adaptation are called regularly-firing neurons ([102](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib5 "Intrinsic firing patterns of diverse cortical neurons")). Adaptation is a slow process that builds up over several spikes. Since the standard leaky integrate-and-fire model resets the voltage after each spike to the same value and restarts the integration process, no memory is kept beyond the most recent spike. Therefore, the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron cannot capture adaptation. Detailed neuron models, which will be discussed in Chapter [2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.html "Chapter 2 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition"), explicitly describe the slow processes that lead to adaptation. To mimic these processes in integrate-and-fire neurons, we need to add up the contributions to refractoriness of several spikes back in the past. As we will see in Chapter [6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch6.html "Chapter 6 Adaptation and Firing Patterns ‣ Part II Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition"), this can be done in the ‘filter’ framework of Eq. ([1.22](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html#Ch1.E22 "(1.22) ‣ 1.3.5 Linear Differential Equation vs. Linear Filter: Two Equivalent Pictures (*) ‣ 1.3 Integrate-And-Fire Models ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")) by using a filter  for refractoriness with a time constant much slower than that of the membrane potential. Or by combining the differential equation of the leaky integrate-and-fire model with a second differential equation describing the evolution of a slow variable; cf. Chapter [6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch6.html "Chapter 6 Adaptation and Firing Patterns ‣ Part II Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition").

Fast-spiking neurons (A) have short interspike intervals without adaptation while regular-spiking neurons (C) exhibit adaptation, visible as an increase in the duration of interspike intervals. An example of a stuttering neuron is shown in B. Many neurons emit an inhibitory rebound spike (D) after an inhibitory current  is switched off. Data is a courtesy of Henry Markram and Maria Toledo-Rodriguez ([329](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib6 "Interneurons of the neocortical inhibitory system"); [514](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib2 "Correlation maps allow neuronal electrical properties to be predicted from single-cell gene expression profiles in rat neocortex")).

A second class of neurons are fast-spiking neurons. These neurons show no adaptation (cf. Fig. [1.10](#Ch1.F10 "Fig. 1.10 ‣ 1.4.1 Adaptation, Bursting, and Inhibitory Rebound ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")A) and can therefore be well approximated by non-adapting integrate-and-fire models. Many inhibitory neurons are fast-spiking neurons. Apart from regular-spiking and fast-spiking neurons, there are also bursting and stuttering neurons which form a separate group ([102](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib5 "Intrinsic firing patterns of diverse cortical neurons")). These neurons respond to constant stimulation by a sequence of spikes that is periodically (bursting) or aperiodically (stuttering) interrupted by rather long intervals; cf. Fig. [1.10](#Ch1.F10 "Fig. 1.10 ‣ 1.4.1 Adaptation, Bursting, and Inhibitory Rebound ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")B. Again, a neuron model that has no memory beyond the most recent spike cannot describe bursting, but the framework in Eq. ([1.22](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S3.html#Ch1.E22 "(1.22) ‣ 1.3.5 Linear Differential Equation vs. Linear Filter: Two Equivalent Pictures (*) ‣ 1.3 Integrate-And-Fire Models ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")) with arbitrary ‘filters’ is general enough to account for bursting as well.

Another frequently observed behavior is post-inhibitory rebound. Consider a step current with  and , i.e., an inhibitory input that is switched off at time ; cf. Fig. [1.10](#Ch1.F10 "Fig. 1.10 ‣ 1.4.1 Adaptation, Bursting, and Inhibitory Rebound ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")D. Many neurons respond to such a change with one or more ‘rebound spikes’: Even the release of inhibition can trigger action potentials. We will return to inhibitory rebound in Chapter [3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch3.html "Chapter 3 Dendrites and Synapses ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition").

In the previous paragraph we focused on an isolated neuron stimulated by an applied current. In reality, neurons are embedded into a large network and receive input from many other neurons. Suppose a spike from a presynaptic neuron  is sent at time  towards the synapse of a postsynaptic neuron . When we introduced in Fig. [1.5](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch1.S2.html#Ch1.F5 "Fig. 1.5 ‣ 1.2.1 Postsynaptic Potentials ‣ 1.2 Elements of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition") the postsynaptic potential that is generated after the arrival of the spike at the synapse, its shape and amplitude did not depend on the state of the postsynaptic neuron . This is of course a simplification and reality is somewhat more complicated. In Chapter [3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch3.html "Chapter 3 Dendrites and Synapses ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition") we will discuss detailed neuron models that describe synaptic input as a change of the membrane conductance. Here we simply summarize the major phenomena.

In Fig. [1.11](#Ch1.F11 "Fig. 1.11 ‣ 1.4.2 Shunting Inhibition and Reversal Potential ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition") we have sketched schematically an experiment where the neuron is driven by a constant current . We assume that  is too weak to evoke firing so that, after some relaxation time, the membrane potential settles at a constant value . At  one of the presynaptic neurons emits a spike so that shortly afterwards the action potential arrives at the synapse and provides additional stimulation of the postsynaptic neuron. More precisely, the spike generates a current pulse at the postsynaptic neuron (postsynaptic current, PSC) with amplitude

<table id="Ch1.E33"><tbody><tr><td></td><td><math id="Ch1.E33.m1" alttext="{\rm PSC}\propto\quad[u_{0}-E_{\rm syn}]" display="block"><semantics><mrow><mi>PSC</mi><mo>∝</mo><mo mathvariant="italic" separator="true"> </mo><mrow><mo stretchy="false">[</mo><msub><mi>u</mi><mn>0</mn></msub><mo>-</mo><msub><mi>E</mi><mi>syn</mi></msub><mo stretchy="false">]</mo></mrow></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">{\rm PSC}\propto\quad[u_{0}-E_{\rm syn}]</annotation></semantics></math></td><td></td><td rowspan="1">(1.33)</td></tr></tbody></table>

where  is the membrane potential and  is the ‘reversal potential’ of the synapse. Since the amplitude of the current input depends on , the response of the postsynaptic potential does so as well. Reversal potentials are systematically introduced in Chapter [2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.html "Chapter 2 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition"); models of synaptic input are discussed in Chapter [3.1](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch3.S1.html "3.1 Synapses ‣ Chapter 3 Dendrites and Synapses ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition").

Example: Shunting inhibition

The dependence of the postsynaptic response upon the momentary state of the neuron is most pronounced for inhibitory synapses. The reversal potential of inhibitory synapses  is below, but usually close to the resting potential. Input spikes thus have hardly any effect on the membrane potential if the neuron is at rest; cf. Fig. [1.11](#Ch1.F11 "Fig. 1.11 ‣ 1.4.2 Shunting Inhibition and Reversal Potential ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")A. However, if the membrane is depolarized, the very same input spikes evoke a larger inhibitory postsynaptic potential. If the membrane is already hyperpolarized, the input spike can even produce a depolarizing effect. There is an intermediate value  – the reversal potential – where the response to inhibitory input ‘reverses’ from hyperpolarizing to depolarizing.

Though inhibitory input usually has only a small impact on the membrane potential, the local conductivity of the cell membrane can be significantly increased. Inhibitory synapses are often located on the soma or on the shaft of the dendritic tree. Due to their strategic position, a few inhibitory input spikes can ‘shunt’ the whole input that is gathered by the dendritic tree from hundreds of excitatory synapses. This phenomenon is called ‘shunting inhibition’.

The reversal potential for excitatory synapses is usually significantly above the resting potential. If the membrane is depolarized  the amplitude of an excitatory postsynaptic potential is reduced, but the effect is not as pronounced as for inhibition. For very high levels of depolarization a saturation of the EPSPs can be observed; cf. [1.11](#Ch1.F11 "Fig. 1.11 ‣ 1.4.2 Shunting Inhibition and Reversal Potential ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition")B.

A. A presynaptic spike that arrives at time  at an inhibitory synapse has hardly any effect on the membrane potential when the neuron is at rest, but a large effect if the membrane potential  is above the resting potential. If the membrane is hyperpolarized below the reversal potential of the inhibitory synapse, the response to the presynaptic input changes sign. B. A spike at an excitatory synapse evokes a postsynaptic potential with an amplitude that depends only slightly on the momentary voltage . For large depolarizations the amplitude saturates and becomes smaller. (Schematic figure.)

The shape of the postsynaptic potentials does not only depend on the level of depolarization but, more generally, on the internal state of the neuron, e.g., on the timing relative to previous action potentials.

Suppose that an action potential has occurred at time  and that a presynaptic spike arrives at a time  at the synapse . The form of the postsynaptic potential depends now on the time ; cf. Fig. [1.12](#Ch1.F12 "Fig. 1.12 ‣ 1.4.4 Spatial Structure ‣ 1.4 Limitations of the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Model ‣ Chapter 1 Introduction: Neurons and Mathematics ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition"). If the presynaptic spike arrives during or shortly after a postsynaptic action potential, it has little effect because some of the ion channels that were involved in firing the action potential are still open. If the input spike arrives much later, it generates a postsynaptic potential of the usual size. We will return to this effect in Chapter [2](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch2.html "Chapter 2 Ion Channels and the Hodgkin-Huxley Model ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition").

![](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/x21.png) Fig. 1.12: The shape of postsynaptic potentials (dashed lines) depends on the time  that has passed since the last output spike of neuron . The postsynaptic spike has been triggered at time . A presynaptic spike that arrives at time  shortly after the spike of the postsynaptic neuron has a smaller effect than a spike that arrives much later. Data is a courtesy of Thomas Berger ([49](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib7 "Frequency-dependent disynaptic inhibition in the pyramidal network: a ubiquitous pathway in the developing rat neocortex")).

The form of postsynaptic potentials also depends on the location of the synapse on the dendritic tree. Synapses that are located far away from the soma are expected to evoke a smaller postsynaptic response at the soma than a synapse that is located directly on the soma; cf. Chapter [3](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch3.html "Chapter 3 Dendrites and Synapses ‣ Part I Foundations of Neuronal Dynamics ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition"). If several inputs occur on the same dendritic branch within a few milliseconds, the first input will cause local changes of the membrane potential that influence the amplitude of the response to the input spikes that arrive slightly later. This may lead to saturation or, in the case of so-called ‘active’ currents, to an enhancement of the response. Such nonlinear interactions between different presynaptic spikes are neglected in the leaky integrate-and-fire model. Whereas a purely linear dendrite can be incorporated in the ‘filter’ description of the model, as we will see in Chapter [6](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/Ch6.html "Chapter 6 Adaptation and Firing Patterns ‣ Part II Generalized Integrate-and-Fire Neurons ‣ Neuronal Dynamics – From Single Neurons to Networks
and Models of Cognition"), nonlinear interactions cannot. Small regions on the dendrite where a strong nonlinear boosting of synaptic currents occurs are sometimes called dendritic ’hot spots’. The boosting can lead to dendritic spikes which, in contrast to normal somatic action potentials last for tens of milliseconds ([289](https://neuronaldynamics.epfl.ch/online/bib.html#bib8 "Synaptic clustering by dendritic signalling mechanisms")).
